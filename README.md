# TaskTrain QA Externship – February to April 2025  
**Hosted by TripleTen**

## Project Description  
This repository highlights the QA work I completed during a seven-week externship on the *TaskTrain* app — a platform for managing and creating SOPs. Our team of 9 was tasked with validating core features through exploratory and regression testing, writing and reviewing Gherkin feature files, documenting detailed bug reports in Jira, and presenting a full QA execution report at project completion.

## Key Responsibilities  
- **Exploratory & Regression Testing:** Executed functional and black box testing across 3 core modules: Procedures, Convert from Document, and Exchange.  
- **Test Case Execution & Documentation:** Authored and executed 101 test cases using Google Sheets, covering new and existing functionality.  
- **Bug Reporting:** Reported 29 bugs in Jira, ranging from UI/UX issues to functional errors. Logged severity levels and reproduction steps to streamline developer response.  
- **Gherkin Feature File Creation:** Wrote new Gherkin feature files based on exploratory test findings to support future automation.  
- **Team Collaboration:** Participated in 7 team meetings, collaborated through Discord and Zoom, and provided peer feedback on test case coverage and bug reproducibility.  
- **Presentation & Reporting:** Contributed to our final QA report and project presentation, which included testing metrics, recommendations, and priority bug highlights.

## Tools Used  
- **Test Management:** Google Sheets  
- **Bug Reporting:** Jira  
- **Communication:** Discord, Zoom  
- **Test Design:** Gherkin  
- **Testing Techniques:** Black Box Testing, Regression Testing, Exploratory Testing

## Conclusion  
This externship gave me the opportunity to apply my QA knowledge in a real-world team environment while expanding my skills in exploratory testing, Gherkin syntax, and execution reporting. Collaborating with others, communicating findings, and presenting clear results reinforced my confidence as a QA professional and prepared me for a fast-paced engineering team.
